# kauri-fullstack-dapp-tutorial-series

This repository holds the example and reference code for the *Add link to series when live on kauri*

In this series, we'll build a simple dApp (decentralised application)
 
We'll introduce all the different pieces of the tech stack and tools you can use to build a dApp
 
The dApp will simply allow any user to issue a bounty in ETH

* Any user with an Ethereum account can Issue a bounty in ETH with the requirements
* Any user can submit a fulfillment of the bounty with evidence
* The bounty issuer can accept a fulfilment which would result in the fulfiller being paid out
